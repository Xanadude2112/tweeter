# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone that uses DOM Manipulation, AJAX, jQuery, JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS.

On this site, you can find a couple of familiar UI and UX features that have been implemented for a slightly improved UX that read as follows;

- For a slightly more pleasing UX, the user may click on the double-down facing arrows under "Write a new tweeter" where they will be immediately directed to the text area to compose a tweet.

- The user may click on the like and retweet buttons which will similarly simulate the real life X (Twitter) functions. This is simulated by simply increasing the value by one of the respective button upon each click.

- Should the user implement hashtags or "@" symbols when tagging someone in their tweeter, once posted, they will have similar behaviours to their respective X (Twitter) counterparts (being coloured blue and darken slightly when you hover over them).

- Lastly, if the tweeter the user composes is over the 140 character count, or simply has written nothing at all, they will be met with an appropriate error message that will forbid them to submit the errored tweeter.
